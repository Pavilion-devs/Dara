Hey sorry for the delay. We were waiting few things to go live with some of the other sponsors like CSPL by Arcium.

Here are some ideas you could work on:

- A dark pool for memecoins to trade with privacy.
- A privacy focused memecoin launched on Anoncoin launchpad that raises awareness about privacy via memetics
- Verify users’ X, their follower count, followed by without doxxing their identity 
- An anonymous social app built on top of X social graph
- Helping creators pre buy their coin through anonymous distributed wallets  
- Anonymous swaps for coins created on Anoncoin
- Anonymous pre sale for a token launch


Apologies for the major delay from our side. We’re sharing this now: teams can build privacy-first experiments around memecoins, social identity, and trading, enabling participation without doxxing users.

1) Trading & Market Structure
• Dark pool for memecoins: private intent / private execution so traders can buy/sell without leaking size, direction, or entry.
• Anonymous swaps for Anoncoin-launched tokens: privacy-preserving swap UX that feels native for memecoins.
• Anonymous presale / private launch mechanics: allow early participation without exposing wallets publicly. 

2) Identity & Reputation
• Verify X account + follower count without doxxing: prove “this user has X followers” (or meets criteria) without revealing identity or linking wallets.
• Anonymous social app on top of X social graph: interact, post, and coordinate while keeping wallet/user identity unlinkable.

3) Launch & Creator Tooling
• Privacy-focused memecoin launch: a token launched on Anoncoin that spreads privacy awareness via memetics (fun + educational).
• Anonymous distributed pre-buy for creators: help creators bootstrap liquidity/participation using distributed wallets to reduce doxxing / clustering.
• Anonymous pre-buy rails: privacy-preserving flows for creators and early community members.

API docs you can use to deploy coins: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9760632/2sBXVhEr4U#intro

Feel free to go beyond these docs too, they’re just one entry point. You can also explore the other privacy facets we mentioned (trading infra like dark pools / private swaps, privacy-preserving X identity & reputation, anonymous social on X graph, distributed/anonymous pre-buys, and private presales).
